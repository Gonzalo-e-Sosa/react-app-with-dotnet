# Unit Tests Folder

This folder contains unit tests for the React application. All test files should be placed here to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Purpose

- Organize and store unit tests for individual components, utilities, and functions.
- Facilitate automated testing and continuous integration.

## Expected Files

- Test files with the `.test.js`, `.test.jsx`, `.test.ts`, or `.test.tsx` extensions.
- Optional setup files (e.g., `setupTests.js`) if specific test configuration is needed.
- Mock files or helpers used exclusively for unit testing.

**Do not** place integration or end-to-end tests in this folder; those should be stored in their respective directories.
